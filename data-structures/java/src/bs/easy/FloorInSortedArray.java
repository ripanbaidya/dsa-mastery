 *
 * Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element
 * in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an
 * element does not exist, return -1.
 *
 * Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the last occurrence.
 *
 * Examples
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19], x = 5
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Largest number less than or equal to 5 is 2, whose index is 1.
