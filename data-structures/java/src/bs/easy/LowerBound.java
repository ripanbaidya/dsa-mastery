 * Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the lower bound of the
 * target in this given array. The lower bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in
 * the sorted array where the element is greater than or equal to the given number.
 *
 * Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than the target, the lower bound
 * will be the length of the array.
 *
 * Examples :
 *
 * Input:  arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[] where element (arr[3] = 10) is greater than or
 * equal to 9.
