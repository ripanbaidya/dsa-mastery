 * Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
 * According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in
 * a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
 * It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 * Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: 6
