 *
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached
 * again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the
 * index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed
 * as a parameter.
 * - Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
