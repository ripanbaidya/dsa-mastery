 *
 * You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.
 * The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋
 * denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.
 *
 * For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
 *
 * Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
 * Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
 * Explanation:
 * The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
 * Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
 * We return the new list after removing this node.
