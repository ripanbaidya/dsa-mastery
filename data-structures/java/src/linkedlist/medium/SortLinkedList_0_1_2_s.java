 *
 * Given the head of a linked list where nodes can contain values 0s, 1s, and 2s only.
 * Your task is to rearrange the list so that all 0s appear at the beginning, followed
 * by all 1s, and all 2s are placed at the end.
 *
 * Input: head = 1 → 2 → 2 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 2 → 2
 * Output: 0 → 1 → 1 → 2 → 2 → 2 → 2 → 2
 * Explanation: All the 0s are segregated to the left end of the linked list, 2s to the right end of the list, and 1s in between.
