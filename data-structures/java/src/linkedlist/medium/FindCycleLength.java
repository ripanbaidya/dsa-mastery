 *
 * Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop.
 * If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.
 * - Note: 'c' is the position of the node which is the next pointer of the last node
 * of the linked list. If c is 0, then there is no loop.
 *
 * Input: head: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5, c = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4
